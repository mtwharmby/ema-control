Robot class should create a socket and provide methods to use that socket to
pass instructions through that socket to the robot. Methods on the module
should then use an instance of this class to send commands to achieve tasks.

    TODO
    - When does the homing procedure actually need to be run?
    - Add recording of last mounted sample
    - Add recording of last message sent
    - Add state machine to allow recovery if software crashes
